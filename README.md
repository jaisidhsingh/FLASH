# FLASH - Flashcard Leveraging Agentic Study Help
Flash is an Application that automatically generates Anki Flashcards out of your Notes, Lecture Slides or Papers (in .pdf Format).
It integrates seamlessly with Anki and saves the cards directly into your Anki storage. It even syncs automatically, if you have syncing set up!

### How do I use this?
If you're on Windows, simply dowload the .exe file provided here and run it!

You can also build the project yourself like so:

```shell
npm run init
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```shell
npm run init
```

```shell
npm run start
```

```shell
npm run build
```
