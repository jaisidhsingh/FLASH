Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\nand sophisticated model con\ue001gurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\ne\ue002orts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser , an open-source\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\nzation pipelines. We demonstrate thatLayoutParseris helpful for both\nlightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\nThe library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io .\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis ·Deep Learning ·Layout Analysis\n·Character Recognition·Open Source library·Toolkit.\n1 Introduction\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\ndocument image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classi\ue001cation [ 11,\narXiv:2103.15348v2 [cs.CV] 21 Jun 2021', metadata={'source': 'C:\\Users\\linus\\Desktop\\layout_parser.pdf', 'pages': '0-0'})], 'retriever': [VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['Chroma', 'NVIDIAEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.chroma.Chroma object at 0x0000025A0404DC40>)], 'generated_questions': [{'Questions': ['What is the primary driver of recent advances in document image analysis (DIA)?', 'What is the main goal of the LayoutParser library introduced in this paper?', 'What are some of the document processing tasks that the LayoutParser library can be used for?']}], 'deduplicated_questions': {'Questions': ['What is the primary driver of recent advances in document image analysis (DIA)?', 'What are some of the document processing tasks that the LayoutParser library can be used for?', 'What is the main goal of the LayoutParser library introduced in this paper?']}, 'questions_with_answers': [{'Question': 'What is the primary driver of recent advances in document image analysis (DIA)?', 'Answer': 'The primary driver of recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) has been the application of neural networks.'}, {'Question': 'What are some of the document processing tasks that the LayoutParser library can be used for?', 'Answer': 'LayoutParser can be used for various document processing tasks, including layout detection, character recognition, and document image classification.'}, {'Question': 'What is the main goal of the LayoutParser library introduced in this paper?', 'Answer': 'The main goal of the LayoutParser library is to streamline the usage of deep learning in document image analysis research and applications.'}], 'notes': [{'Type': 'Basic', 'Front': 'Primary driver of recent advances in document image analysis (DIA)', 'Back': 'The application of neural networks'}, {'Type': 'Basic', 'Front': 'Main goal of the LayoutParser library', 'Back': 'To streamline the usage of deep learning in document image analysis research and applications.'}]}
